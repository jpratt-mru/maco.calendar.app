# maco.calendar.app

## Overview

This is a kind of a calendar-ish app.
You drop one of two things on it:

* a uniquely formatted spreadsheet from Scheduling, or
* a source dump of the desired semester schedule from myMRU

and then it does some neat things for you:

* displays the lab/tut/lec schedule for all course sections in a calendar,
* lets you filter the weekly display based on instructor, course, or room
* provides warnings about:
  * rooms that are booked over their seating capacity,
  * rooms that are double-booked
  * instructors that are double-booked
* provides a way to print off a schedule as a pdf,
* provides a way to export a schedule to Google Calendar,
